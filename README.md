## Overview of Project

The **TravelPlan** web application allows users to:

- View and manage travel plans (add, edit, delete).
- Display travel plans linked to specific locations and users.
- View a list of all travel plans along with their location and travelers.
- Interact with a user-friendly interface built with **Material-UI** for seamless navigation and user experience.

The app has been designed with responsive features, animations, and a clean UI to make sharing travel plans both simple and enjoyable.

There are different validations in place so that the data that is received into the  server is good data. Some examples of the validations are below:
    The username must be unique. This is a column constraint in the user model.

    All fields in the form are required so no empty data can be submitted.

### Features

- **Travel Plan Management**: Add, edit, or delete travel plans easily. 
- **Location-Based Plans**: View all travel plans for a specific location.
- **Traveler-Specific Plans**: View all travel plans associated with a specific user.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to various screen sizes using Material-UI's responsive grid system.
- **Smooth Animations**: The welcome page introduces interactive animations (Grow, Slide) to present the content dynamically.
